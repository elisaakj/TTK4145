# TTK4145 - Lab work

This project implements a distributed elevator system using Go. The system manages multiple elevators, synchronizes their states over a network, and assigns hall and cab calls.

Mention peer-to-peer or master-slave?


## Running the project

Before running the program, ensure that either the elevatorserver or the simulator (https://github.com/TTK4145/Simulator-v2) is active. Then, starte the program using:
    '''bash
    go run main.go -idX
    '''
Here, the id X must match the port assigned to the elevator/simulator.
